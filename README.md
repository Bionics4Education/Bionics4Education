# Bionics4Education Kit

[Bionics4Education](https://www.bionics4education.com/web/lang/de/1_education.html) is an innovating learning environment which gets inspired of the beauty of nature.

Within a project-based learning experience educators can emphasizes their students creativity, innovation and problem solving.
The bionics kit from Festo consists of components with which three different nature-inspired animal robots can be built according to the model of Festo's bionics projects. All robots are controlled by a microcontroller whose source code is provided here.

You are looking for further activities with the Bionics4Education Kit? Check out our [DIY-Projects](https://github.com/Festo-se/Bionics4Education/tree/master/bionic_kit/DIY_Projects). After you get some additional material like some sensors, cables, resistors or a LED you can programm the animals individually and explore the world of Bionics.  [Here](https://www.bionics4education.com/startseite/stem/diy-projects) on our website you can watch the Videos how it will look like when you succeeded  the different tasks.

# Bionic Flower
The Bionic Flower is a robot flower inspired by the world of plants. The Bionic Flower opens and closes its petals as a reaction to external influences such as touch, approximity or light. Students can explore these mechanisms in a playful way using sensors and control technology. You can find the firmware of the Bionic Fower [here](https://github.com/Festo-se/Bionics4Education/tree/master/bionic_flower)
Want to start program it yourself? No problem. Just look into our [Bionic Flower Basic example](https://github.com/Festo-se/Bionics4Education/tree/master/bionic_flower/Start_Coding_yourself). If you downloaded the [Arduino Portable Version](https://github.com/Festo-se/Bionics4Education/tree/master/Arduino_Portable) from our [Website](https://www.bionics4education.com/home/support?lang=de=) you will find the examples within the Sketchbook folder within the Arduino IDE or otherwise just here on GitHub.

# Installguide

A detailed description on how to flash the microcontroller of the Bionics4Education Kit and how to install the needed software can be found [here](https://github.com/Festo-se/Bionics4EducationKit/blob/master/installguide/mainfile/install_guide.md).
***Update*** If you don't want to download and install die Arduino IDE manually, you can download an Arduino Portable Version from our [Website](https://www.bionics4education.com/home/support?lang=de=).  This version has all necessary and pre-installed settings so it gives you an easierer and faster way to jump into coding yourself. Just download the .zip file and follow our [instructions](https://github.com/Festo-se/Bionics4Education/tree/master/Arduino_Portable).
